# Kevin Kredit

Hello! I'm a software developer interested in building secure and high quality systems.

I currently work on
backend services in Go. I love programming in new and interesting programming languages, but lately am more interested
in applying lightweight formal methods using tools like [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html) and
[Alloy](http://alloytools.org/), which show more promise than languages alone for preventing and detecting truly costly 
bugs.

I finished a master's degree in Applied Computer Science in December, 2020. I am working to publish my thesis on the
"wicked problem" of encryption technology and policy.

Feel free to reach me at knkredit60 at gmail dot com.
