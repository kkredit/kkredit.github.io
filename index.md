## Kevin Kredit

Hello! I'm a software developer interested in programming languages, security, and quality. Besides tinkering with
software I love history and hiking.

Some of my favorite talks and courses:

- Frontend Masters' ["Hardcore Functional Programming"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/hardcore-js-v2/) and
  ["Architecture"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/hardcore-js-patterns/) in JavaScript, with Brian Lonsdorf
- This Rich Hickey
  [presentation](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/AreWeThereYet.md) on the epochal
  time model used in Clojure, Elm, and Redux
- This Uncle Bob Martin talk on clean architecture and
  [domain driven design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_TH-Y78tt4)

Below are links to a few of my projects on GitHub.

- An [Elm SPA](https://github.com/kkredit/arg-viewer) for viewing [Argdown](https://argdown.org) argument maps
- A [puzzle solving](https://github.com/kkredit/scramble-squares-solvers) program written in C, Clojure, Go, Haskell, and Rust
- A smart home [threat model](https://github.com/kkredit/smart-home-threat-model)

I finished a master's degree in Applied Computer Science in December, 2020. I am working to publish my thesis on the
"wicked problem" of encryption and exceptional access.
