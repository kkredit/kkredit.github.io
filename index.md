## Kevin Kredit

Hello! I'm a software developer interested in programming languages, security, and quality. Besides tinkering with
software I love history and hiking.

Below are a few links to see some of the work I've done.

- A [puzzle solving](https://github.com/kkredit/scramble-squares-solvers) program written in C, Clojure, Go, Haskell, and Rust
- A smart home [threat model](https://github.com/kkredit/smart-home-threat-model)
- A macro-based "option type" [implementation for C](https://github.com/kkredit/c_options)
- An opinionated C [error handling library](https://github.com/kkredit/z_check)
- An MQTT security [Android app](https://github.com/kkredit/MQTT-sweeper-android)
- A web app with a React [frontend](https://github.com/kkredit/slp-therapy-tracker) and Rails [backend](https://github.com/kkredit/slp-therapy-tracker-backend)
- A formal [resume](https://github.com/kkredit/resume/blob/master/example/example-resume.pdf)

I'm currently finishing up a degree in Applied Computer Science and working on a thesis on the wicked problem of
encryption and exceptional access.

The best way to reach me is actually at knkredit60 at gmail dot com. I'd love to hear from you.
